"Tranlsations" is a project which provides Hindi translation to essays written by Paul Graham. Paul is a prominent essayist, painter, computer scientist, and investor. His essays have positively influenced my thought process over time. This is an effort to make his writings clear to people who struggle with understanding English.

All kinds of suggestions and improvements are welcome for these translations.
